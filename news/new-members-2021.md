I'm very happy to welcome the newest members of out team who have joined us
these past few months:

  [Vanderlei C. Oliveira Jr](https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/oliveira-jr.html),
  and [Richard Holme](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/~holme/).
  India will be working on
  [Antarctic geothermal heat flow estimates from magnetic data](/news/liverpool-phd-2021.html).
* **Gelson Ferreira de Souza Junior** is starting a PhD at the University of
  SÃ£o Paulo on magnetic microscopy under the supervision of
  [Ricardo I. F. Trindade](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ricardo-Trindade)
  and co-supervised by me.
* **Sarah Askevold**, **Laura Nicholls**, and **Hamed Rashid Hamed Al-Salehi**
  are doing their final year dissertation projects with me this year. Sarah and
  Laura will be contributing to some of the [open-source software](/software)
  we develop and Hamed will be continuing our work on
  [equivalent source processing of gravity data](https://github.com/compgeolab/eql-gradient-boosted).

It's always a pleasure to start new collaborations and I'm looking forward to
working with them on their projects!
